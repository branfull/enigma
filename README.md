Functionality: 3.5+
- I don't think I accounted for every single edge case but #crack works.

OOP: 2.5 - 3
- I really struggled trying to find classes outside of Enigma. It wasn't until
  much later in the project that I kind of felt okay breaking it out into other
  classes.

Ruby Convensions and Mechanics: 3
- It's only my #crack method that I don't feel great about the way it looks.

Test Driven Development: 2.5 - 3
- I tested every method, all aspects of a method are tested, I used mocks on
  a few tests. There were a couple of times early on where I got ahead of myself in
  writing methods rather than using tests. It especially got out of hand as I
  was tinkering through #crack. Because of the complexity of my #crack method,
  I have 98% coverage.
